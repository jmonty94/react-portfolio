                    <p>
                        Hello and welcome! My name is James Montgomery and I am a father of two under two who decided that a 
                        never ending pandemic, threat of nuclear war, and looming possibility of yet another recession in my lifetime
                        was the perfect time to switch carreer paths and become a developer. Jokes aside I have thoroughly enjoyed 
                        my experience so far and am only regretting not starting sooner and thanks to my wonderfully supportive wife I have had the time
                        and resources needed to venture forth into the unknown. I have a long background in Tech prior to becoming
                        a developer. I worked for the largest CAD SaaS company in the world prior to my change and it is actually the driving force
                        behind the change. I desire to help create the most intuitive and user friendly applications in an effort to cut down
                        on needless customer contacts. Time is money as they say.
